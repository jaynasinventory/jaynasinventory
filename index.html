	    <p><strong>Hi! My name is Jayna, and welcome to Jayna's Inventory! I am a 17 year old senior at Waubonsie Valley High School. I love to create art, listen to music, hang out with friends and family, and travel. My passion of creating began when I was very young, and I now want to journey out and achieve more with my passion. I believe that hand-crafted items are so much more valuable, and they can be the key to feeling comfort. I hope that you enjoy Jayna's Inventory, and that I can craft something you love!</strong></p>
